## Inspiration
India is a land of Rich Culture and Varied Diversity. A land with various religions, languages, traditions. Still, many people don't know various festivals which people of certain tribes celebrate. So we thought of building this so that we can provide information to everyone about such less known festivals including well-known festivals.

## What it does
It showcases information about less known festivals of various tribes/religions such as the region it is celebrated in, when it is celebrated, some images of the festival, how it is celebrated etc. We also thought of displaying images of products of local sellers during a particular festival so that they can get a profit as well and it will support Vocal for local.

## How we built it
We collected info about some festivals, images etc. Created a frontend with a great User Interface and easy for users to navigate through. The website will display all the information related to the festivals. At the backend, we've used nodejs which will do certain processing before displaying. Also, we provide a newsletter which user will get before a festival arrive so they can know about it and prepare for it accordingly. For email notifications, we have used Courier.com.

## Challenges we ran into
Collecting information about festivals and images, email notification about the festival. As the hackathons are virtual it was difficult to collaborate with team members. But using GitHub and Discord helped us to collaborate with each other.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As this is our first-ever hackathon, we got a lot of things to learn. Also, we are able to make the product as we were thought of. This is the biggest accomplishments we have.

## What we learned
We got a lot to learn from this hackathon as well as the project,  such as time management, collaborations, etc. We got to know about some new technologies and APIs. Their Integration. First time doing all these things was fun.

## What's next for Sanskriti
Sanskriti (Culture) is the Future. People are getting too much attached to new technology and it is making them forget about the culture. Sanskriti will help to retain the Indian culture, will make many people aware of the culture. In the future, the newsletter will also show users how to celebrate the festival. We will approach the local vendors to promote their festive products on the Sanskriti platform. Sanskriti can be a great community of like-minded people who are willing to retain the Indian Culture, by celebrating it, and by sharing about it.
